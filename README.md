# HORECA_XGBoost
This machine learning project focuses on solving a classification problem where the objective is to categorize customers into two channels: Horeca (Hotel/Retail/Caf√©) and Retail. Leveraging the powerful XGBoost algorithm through Python and Scikit-Learn, the project endeavors to enhance the precision and efficiency of channel classification.

The dataset encompasses critical features such as 'Region,' 'Fresh,' 'Milk,' 'Grocery,' 'Frozen,' 'Detergents_Paper,' and 'Delicassen,' with the 'Channel' variable serving as the target to be predicted. The 'Channel' variable is encoded with values 1 and 2, representing Horeca and Retail channels, respectively
